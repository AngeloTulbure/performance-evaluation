## Fitting

The enclosed files Trace1.csv and Trace2.csv contain a single column that reports the service times of two different file servers. 

I computed for each file the first three moments, then I fitted the samples against:
- The Uniform, the Exponential and the Erlang distributions using direct expressions.
- The Weibull and the Pareto distributions with the method of moments.
- The two stage Hyper-Exponential and the two stage Hypo-Exponential distributions using the maximum likelihood technique.

The plotted figures are the comparisons for each trace of the empirical CDF of the samples with the CDF of the distributions, with the parameters obtained from the corresponding fitting procedures.
